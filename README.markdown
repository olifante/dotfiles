Olifante's Dot Files
====================

Here are most of my config files.
It includes vim configuration and plugins, my scripts and some Linux config files.

Installation
------------

If you want to try my config, just clone and deploy with:

    git clone git://github.com/v0n/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    bash install.sh

This script will prompt you to create/overwrite each file (empty answer is equivalent to no).
